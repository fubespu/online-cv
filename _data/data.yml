    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Political Science was my field of expertise for many years, from my early college years to later PhD (unfinished) my passion was all about trying to explain changes in society with numbers. My first dissertation was about "Water and conflict", something that back then (2010) was already a discussion topic. Now, water is being traded on Wall Street.
      It was back then during my college years that I developed a passion for statistics and research. One of my tutors, Javier Torres Vela (President of the Andalusian Parlament) introduced us to the incredible topic of demoscopy in electoral processes and how accurate data well read can affect the result of an election.
      I was totally deboted to the idea of knowning more about society and it's changes than others. As a generation Z and basically born into the era of technological advance thanks to the use of the internet, I naturally developed two basic instincts: 1) affinity to computers and 2) TV isn't always telling the truth (probably it isn't most of the time).
      This two habilities pushed me in what was then called "Social Media" but which we only called "messenger". I joined Facebook in January 2008, almost to the date 3 months before it's official launch in Spain and sind then I've been actively using the platform. I later found out that this was an important event that helped me understand the sociologic phenomenon of political polarization.
      Political polarization has been a topic I wrote about in essays, conferences, book chapters, master dissertations and that finally ended up being the central part of my PhD "Political Polarization in Social Media". While working on that dissertation I started working for Bang Branding!, a regional branding and communication agency of Murcia (Spain). Ana Martínez and her business partner sparked in me what later would become my professional career as Marketing Manager. 
      After 1.5 years working there as a research assistant, I decided to try and combine this new acquired field of expertise with the one I already developed before: marketing + poltical science. At Dialoga Consultores (Sevilla, Spain) I could deep dive a bit more into the job of the political consultant. However, this experience didn't felt quite right to me and I decided to seek other opportunities on foreig soil. Irland was the choice I made, where I was given the opportunity to work for a Facebook Contractor as Marketing Specialist.
      In the period of 6 months I acquired everything I needed to know about the platform and what is required of what turned out to be my natural development: performance marketing. This field of expertise has been since then my core competence which I was lucky enough to develop working for Holvi, one of (if not THE) biggest B2B FinTech in Europe.
      With my manager's mentorship I quickly developed the essencial skills of a Performance Marketing Manager: be data driven, understand attribution and marketing mix models, A/B testing, budgeting and so on and so forth... After achieving all challenges that were pushed into my way, I was given the opportunity to lead a small team of very talented marketing managers.
      As a leader you will never stop learning about yourself and how to interact with others, I had to learn that my DiSC style (CD = Concient Dominance) had to be compensanted with other soft skills with some team members.
